## 🌱 What is this?

**Hestia** is a full-stack web application built as a capstone project for a Web Application Programming course. Named after the Greek goddess of the hearth and home, it connects **food donors** (restaurants, households, canteens) with **claimants** (NGOs, individuals, food banks) to rescue surplus food before it goes to waste.

Users can post real-time food listings with location, quantity, and expiry windows. Claimants browse, reserve, and coordinate pickups — all tracked on a live impact dashboard showing meals saved and CO₂ avoided.

---

## 👥 User Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `donor` | Post listings, manage own listings, view impact |
| `claimant` | Browse listings, reserve, coordinate pickups |
| `admin` | Approve/reject listings, manage users, view analytics |

Role is selected at registration and encoded in the JWT. Route guards enforce access on both client and server.

---

## ⏱ Reservation Lock

When a claimant reserves a listing, it is **locked for 30 minutes**. If pickup is not confirmed within that window, the listing is automatically released back to the pool. This is handled via:

- A `reservedUntil` timestamp on the `Listing` model
- A Socket.io event that broadcasts the release to all connected clients
- A countdown timer component in React that reflects the remaining lock time live
